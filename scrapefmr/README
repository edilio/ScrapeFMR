A node app for scrapping the fair market rent information provided but HUD department in the public web site.

The app was developed using node and request. The algorithm take is asynchronous.

The data is saved to a file called "fmr.json.arr" into the same folder.

There is commented code because the file I generated was ready for using in Sencha as an Array instead of using json in order to reduce the size of the file almost in half.

Enjoy!!!
